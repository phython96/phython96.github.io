  <p><b>My dream is to witness the emergence of artificial general intelligence and to contribute my efforts.</b></p>
  <p> My doctoral research centered on <b>multi-task agents operating within open-world settings</b>. 
  A core aspect of this work involved identifying and developing a <b>task representation method characterized by high expressiveness, low ambiguity, and scalability for efficient training</b>. 
  In the realm of 3D video games, I spearheaded the development of the <b>GROOT<b/> and <b>ROCKET<b/> series as the first author. 
  These projects empower AI agents to execute intricate tasks in Minecraft based on human instructions, consistently <b>pushing the frontiers of AI agent capabilities within the Minecraft environment<b/>. 
  Concurrently, I've delved into applying <b>reinforcement learning techniques to bolster the visual reasoning abilities of visuomotor agents<b/>. 
  I'm particularly enthusiastic about creating intelligent agents that can <b>perceive and retain information with the fluidity and coherence akin to human cognition<b/>. 
  Furthermore, I actively track the progress in <b>general agents<b/>, holding a strong belief that the <b>scalable generation and validation of tasks within digital worlds is currently the most viable route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)<b/>.
  </p>
  <p><b>Research Interests</b>: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, AI Agents, Embodied Intelligence</p>
