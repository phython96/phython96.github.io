  <p><b>My dream is to witness the emergence of artifical general intelligence and to contribute my own efforts toward it.</b></p>
  <p> During my undergraduate years, I was passionate about studying classical algorithms and participated in algorithm competitions. This not only honed my programming skills but also taught me to approach problems using <b>computational thinking</b>. In graduate school, I delved into deep learning and conducted research in areas such as neural architecture search and computer vision. These experiences allowed me to appreciate the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and marked the beginning of my journey as a researcher. During my doctoral studies, I focused on open-world instruction-following agents as my research topic, diving deep into both the technical and theoretical aspects of this field. Over time, I have developed the ability to examine problems in machine learning from a broader and more unified perspective, often through the lens of probability and learning. I am deeply passionate about the theory and application of general-purpose foundational decision-making models and am committed to advancing research in this area. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Research Interests</b>: Machine Learning, Generative Models, Computer Vision, Robotics, Sequential Control</p>
