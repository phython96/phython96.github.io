  <p><b>My dream is to witness the emergence of AGI and to contribute my efforts.</b></p>
  <p> My doctoral research centered on <b>multi-task agents operating within open-world settings</b>. 
  A core aspect of this work involved identifying and developing a <b>task representation method characterized by high expressiveness, low ambiguity, and scalability for efficient training</b>. 
  In the realm of 3D video games, I spearheaded the development of the <b>GROOT and ROCKET series</b> as the first author. 
  These projects empower AI agents to execute intricate tasks in Minecraft based on human instructions, consistently <b>pushing the frontiers of AI agent capabilities within the Minecraft environment</b>. 
  Concurrently, I've delved into applying <b>reinforcement learning techniques to bolster the visual reasoning abilities of visuomotor agents</b>. 
  I'm particularly enthusiastic about creating intelligent agents that can <b>perceive and retain information with the fluidity and coherence akin to human cognition</b>. 
  Furthermore, I actively track the progress in <b>general agents</b>, holding a strong belief that the <b>scalable generation and validation of tasks within digital worlds is currently the most viable route to achieving AGI</b>.
  </p>
  <p><b>Research Interests</b>: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Embodied Intelligence, LLM Agents</p>
