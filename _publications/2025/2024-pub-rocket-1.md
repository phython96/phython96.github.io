  We aim to develop a goal specification method that is semantically clear, spatially sensitive, and intuitive for human users to guide agent interactions in embodied environments. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-view goal alignment framework that allows users to specify target objects using segmentation masks from their own camera views rather than the agent's observations.
