  This paper proposes a semantic and correlation disentangled graph convolution method, which builds the image-specific graph and employs graph propagation to reason the labels effectively. We introduce a semantic disentangling module to extract category-wise semantic features as nodes and a correlation disentangling module to extract image-specific label correlations as edges. Performing graph convolutions on this image-specific graph allows for better mining of difficult labels with weak visual representations.
