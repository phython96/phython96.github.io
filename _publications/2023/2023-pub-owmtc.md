  This paper identifies two main challenges of learning such policies: 1) the indistinguishability of tasks from the state distribution, due to the vast scene diversity,and 2) the non-stationary nature of environment dynamics caused by partial observability. For first challenge, we present Goal-Sensitive Backbone (GSB) for the policy to encourage the emergence of goal-relevant visual state representations. For the second challenge, the policy is further fueled by an adaptive horizon prediction module that helps alleviate the learning uncertainty.
