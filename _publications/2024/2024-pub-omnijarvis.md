  This paper presents OmniJARVIS, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for open-world instructionfollowing agents in Minecraft. Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data.
