abstract: >-
  Traditional conditional image generation models mainly focus on generating high-quality and visually realistic images, and lack resolving the partial consistency between image and instruction. To address this issue, we propose an Increment Reasoning Generative Adversarial Network (IR-GAN), which aims to reason the consistency between visual increment in images and semantic increment in instructions.
